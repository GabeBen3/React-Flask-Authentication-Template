# Flask-React-Authentication-Template
This is a JWT-based authentification template built with Flask/React. 

It features customizable solutions for:
  - Login/Logout
  - Changing login credentials
  - Email verified password resetting
  - JWT token handling.   

The flask application can be implemented by importing the approriate Flask Blueprint object and initializing the application as the template demonstrates in __init__.py

The React application components features in the frontend folder can be easily imported into existing projects and will make appropriate calls to the server once .env is initialized.
